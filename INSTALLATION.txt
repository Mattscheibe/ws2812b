ws2812b Installation
====================

No special installation is needed. Just copy file ws2812b.h, ws2812b.c and
ws2812b_config.h to a new directory. If you do not want to provide your own
Makefile, also copy provided Makefile to this directory.
You can put your own files there now and start writing your program.
