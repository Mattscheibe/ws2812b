w21812b development of a new program
====================================

An appropriate Makefile is added in Makefile_Template. Edit it to set up
your favorite editor.

1. Copy this Makefile to the directory in which you want to write the new program.

2. Type "make config" and set wich port pin and which wiring scheme is being used.

3. Type "make make" and set file names of your project. Repeat this step if new files happen to be added.

4. Type "make edit" and edit your program.

5. If you add more files to your project either edit them by hand or add editing targets for them to the make file.

6. Test your program by typing "make" (compilation only) or "make prog" (compilation and transfering to chip).

Repeat steps 4. (and 5.) and 6. until finished.
